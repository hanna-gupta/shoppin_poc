# LLM Reasoning and Tool Use: Comparison and Analysis

## **A. Conceptual Map**
Below is a conceptual overview of how LLMs reason and interact with external tools:

- **Toolformer**: Self-supervised API utilization.
- **ReAct**: Interleaves reasoning with tool-based actions.
- **ReST**: Iterative fine-tuning for self-improvement.
- **ATC**: Autonomous tool discovery and execution.
- **LATS**: Unified reasoning, acting, and planning via tree search.

## **B. Analysis of LLM Approaches**


1. **ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models**
   - A framework where LMs synergize reasoning and acting by jointly thinking about problems before taking actions.

2. **Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools**
   - Language models will learn to autonomously use tools, like APIs, through interaction and gameplay. This process improves task performance without supervision.

3. **A Joint Approach Where ReST Meets ReAct - Self-Improvement for Multi-Step Reasoning LLM Agent**
   - Jointly Reinforced Self-Training with ReAct allows agents to use iterative feedback and corrective learning from their actions to improve multi-step reasoning.

4. **Chain of Tools: Large Language Model is an Automatic Multi-tool Learner**
   - An LLM that automatically learns to chain many tools (e.g., APIs or searches) together to proceed stepwise through solutions for complex tasks.

5. **Language Agent Tree Search Unifies Reasoning, Acting, and Planning in Language Models**
   - Introduces **LATS**: a comprehensive framework that unifies reasoning, acting, and planning. It models tasks as decision trees to better handle multi-step problems through structured exploration.

| **ReST (2023)**   | ✅        | ✅     | ❌               | ✅               | ✅            | ✅               |
| **Chain of Tools (2023)** | ✅  | ✅     | ❌               | ✅               | ✅            | ✅               |
| **LATS (2024)**   | ✅        | ✅     | ✅ (MCTS)        | ✅               | ✅ (Limited)  | ✅               |


### **Comparison of Methods**
- **ReST + ReAct**: Combines iterative self-training with real-time reasoning and search-based tool use.
- **ATC**: Moves towards autonomous tool discovery without predefined documentation.
- **LATS**: Integrates structured search (MCTS) for better decision-making.

Each method has trade-offs in adaptability, computational cost, and applicability to complex reasoning tasks.

## **C. Open Questions and Future Research**
### **Challenges**
- **Scalability**: Can iterative methods like ReST scale without prohibitive computational costs?
- **Generalization**: Can ATC and LATS be extended beyond search-based tasks?
- **Error Handling**: How can false success phenomena be minimized in automated tool use?
- **Integration**: Can LLMs seamlessly interact with real-world APIs and heterogeneous data sources?

### **Future Directions**
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining ATC’s autonomous tool learning with LATS’s structured planning.
- **Self-Correcting Mechanisms**: More robust methods for real-time feedback and error correction.
- **Benchmark Expansion**: Standardized evaluation datasets beyond ToolFlow and Bamboogle.
- **LRM Integration**: Experiment and test these approaches against LRMs such as gpt-4-o1 and deepseek-r1.
